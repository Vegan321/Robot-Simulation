#  Robot Simulation

##  Introduction

This repository is to record the robot simulation learning in MUJOCO platform. 

## Challenges in learning

### Inverse kinematics

Inverse kinematics solving is the first challenge I had met. Finally, I found the solution to inverse kinematics solving in Google-deepmind's tutorialsj(https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/least_squares.ipynb#scrollTo=_anJZK-u1MTt).
My code based on deepmind to solve IK problem is about to update soon.
